// //Problem Statement  :

// Raman was playing a game, he starts with x coins. Now in every step, he wins and loses 
// and he has to get the money or pay the money as needed. He came in contact with a psychic 
// who can see the future and the Psychic predicted the outcomes after each step. Now Raman 
// wants to start the game with the minimum wage where he doesnâ€™t run out of money. Help Raman
//  to find what money he should start with. The only rule to keep playing is not going in a
//   credit situation
